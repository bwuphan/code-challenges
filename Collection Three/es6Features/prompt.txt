Today's toy problem will take a bit of a different structure. By the end of toy
problems time, I'd like you to be able to answer the question, "Are there any
EcmaScript 6 features you're excited about?"

Find at least one feature of EcmaScript 6 that is cool or particularly exciting
to you and learn enough to talk about it for a few minutes. Research that
feature and write out two code code examples, one using old-style vanilla
JavaScript and one using the new EcmaScript feature. Be able to explain why the
new version is a significant improvement, or why you disagree with how the new
feature is implemented.


For example, ES6 has a feature similar to string interpolation in Ruby:

var thing = 'something';

ES6:
  `I would like to think you will get ${thing} out of this toy problem`

JavaScript:
  "I would like to think you will get " + thing + " out of this toy problem"



PS: If you'd like to actually test some of ES6's features, the newest version of
Firefox has what seems like the best support for ES6 so far. This table should
give you a better idea of which ES6 features are supported right now and what
aren't:
