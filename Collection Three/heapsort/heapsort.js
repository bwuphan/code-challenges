/**
 * HEAPS EPISODE VI: The Heap Strikes Back
 * =======================================
 *
 * Okay, so it's not that exciting.
 *
 * Heapsort is an algorithm that uses a heap to sort an array. Heapsort works by
 * leveraging a heap's semi-ordered nature; to return an array sorted in
 * ascending order, you'd use a min heap; to sort in descending order, you'd use
 * a max heap.
 *
 * Write a function that uses a heap to sort an array (heapsort!). For time's
 * sake, feel free to reference your old heap implementation.
 *
 * Tip: If you didn't get around to implementing a remove function for your
 * heap, you should start by doing that. You'll need it to implement heapsort.
