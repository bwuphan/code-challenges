/**
 * Today's toy problem is to write a function that can create filler text, i.e.
 * text that doesn't actually mean anything, but from a distance could plausibly
 * look like real language.
 *
 * Implement these features in order:
 * - The argument to function is the number of words the function should return.
 * - The text is made up of sentences with 3-8 words each.
 * - Each word is made up of 1-12 random characters from A-Za-z.
 * - Sentences have first word capitalized and a period at the end.
 * - After each sentence there should be a 15% chance of a newline.
 * - Instead of periods after each sentence, introduce other punctuation marks
 *   (e.g. question marks and exclamation marks).
 * - Put some of the words in "quotes." People love "quotes."
 *
 * If you finish all of this, look into replacing your random letters with
 * pseudo-natural language.
