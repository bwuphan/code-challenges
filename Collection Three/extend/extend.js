/**
 * Extend is a function that copies all of the properties from a source object
 * onto the target object.
 *
 * A shallow-copy version of extend will copy all the top-level properties from
 * a source object, copying the value of all primitive values (strings, numbers,
 * etc.) but copying only a reference to objects and arrays.
 *
 * A deep-copy version of extend will recursively copy all properties of the
 * source object, giving the target a unique copy of any objects and arrays.
 *
 * Write a shallow-copy version of extend, and then write a deep-copy version.
 * Make your deep-copy extend handle an arbitrary number of source objects.
