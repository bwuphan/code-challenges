var hasCycle = function(linkedList){
  //Your beautiful code here
};

/*
Write a function that returns true if a linked list contains a cycle, or false if it terminates somewhere.

Explanation:

Generally, we assume that a linked list will terminate in a null next pointer, as follows:

 A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> null
A ‘cycle’ in a linked list is when traversing the list would result in visiting the same nodes over and over.

This is caused by pointing a node in the list to another node that already appeared earlier in the list. Example:

 A -> B -> C
      ^    |
      |    v
      E <- D
'Constraint 1: Do this in linear time'

'Constraint 2: Do this in constant space'

'Constraint 3: Do not mutate the original nodes in any way'
