/*
Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, donâ€™t worry about repeated strings. What time complexity is your solution?

Parameters:

string (required) - a string of characters.

Examples
Input Output
string:
"abc" [ "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba" ]
